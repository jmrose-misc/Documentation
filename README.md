# Documentation #

This repo acts as an archive to docs that I've written over the years. Different
companies that I have written for employed a variety of methods for distributing
guides. Although I have also written internal support documentation and QA 
instructions, the guides contained within primarily focus on customers as the 
intended reading audience.
