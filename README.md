# Documentation and Project Work #

This repo acts as an archive to my work over the years. As my skills and 
experience expanded, so too did my responsibilities.

| Company       | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Blizzard      | Contains a sample automation script written to support a documentation workflow I developed. Also contains project retrospective documentation.     |
| HiveIO        | PDFs of Administration Guides written for Fabric software.      |
| Devon IT      | Demonstrates my ability to navigate docs-as-code, with several guides written with Markdown and reStructuredText, with Sphinx for documentation generation.     |

If you happen to actually read or review anything here, then I'd like to thank 
you for your time.
