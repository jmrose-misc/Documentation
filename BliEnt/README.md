# 2023 Project #

This is a Scriptrunner Event Listener, deployed within Conlfuence, that sends 
an email based on pages that transition to a "Stale" state within our runbook 
documentation workflow. This script sends an email to the primary points of 
contact for the service the runbook relates to, using data parsed from the Jira 
Insight JSON.
