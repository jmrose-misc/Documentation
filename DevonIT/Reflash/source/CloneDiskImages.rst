Cloning Disk Images with the Reflash Utility
============================================
It is possible clone any disk image that is currently being used on a thin 
client and place the clone into a server for preservation or for sharing.

To clone from the thin client:

1.  Follow the previous steps to open the boot menu and access the Re-Imaging Utility. 
    When the boot menu appears, select the flash drive containing the Re-Imaging Utility and press <Enter>.
2.  Once the boot up is complete the Lenovo Re-Imaging Utility Main Menu is displayed.
3.	Use the arrow keys to select an option that corresponds to the server you wish to clone the disk image to. There are three choices available.

    +  To clone the disk image to an NFS mounted server, select <6> and press <Enter>.
    +  To clone the disk image to Windows Share Network, select <7> and press <Enter>.
    +  To clone the disk image to an FTP server, select <8> and press <Enter>.

4.	If you are asked for credentials, you will need to enter a valid username, 
    password and, in the case of a Windows Share, a domain name.
5.  Once a connection has been established, the image cloning will begin. A 
    progress bar will display the current status of the cloning process. Do not 
    turn off your thin client during this time.
6.  When the cloning is complete, the Re-Imaging Utility will return itself to the Main Menu.
