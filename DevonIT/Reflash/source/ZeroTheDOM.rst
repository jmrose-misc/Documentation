Zeroing the DOM
---------------

The Re-Imaging Utility has the option to zero the DOM to free up hard memory or 
to factory reset a thin client. 

1.  Follow the previous steps to open the boot menu and access the Re-Imaging 
    Utility. When the boot menu appears, select the flash drive containing the 
    Re-Imaging Utility and press ``Enter``.
2.  Once the boot up is complete the Lenovo Re-Imaging Utility Main Menu is 
    displayed.
3.  Use the arrow keys to select the **Zero the DOM** option and press ``Enter``.
4.  A prompt will appear, warning that this will make the terminal unbootable. Select 
    **Yes** to continue. The process may take a few minutes to complete.
5.  After the DOM has been zeroed out, the thin client will reboot. Remove the 
    flash drive when prompted and press ``Enter`` to reboot the terminal. The 
    thin client will not load up any disk images until a new image has been 
    written on.
