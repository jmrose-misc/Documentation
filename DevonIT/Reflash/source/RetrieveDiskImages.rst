Retrieving the Disk Images
--------------------------

The Lenovo Re-Imaging Utility offers three ways to write the disk image. The 
first option is to copy the disk image to a USB Flash drive. At least one disk 
image may be copied onto a flash drive if its capacity is at least 4 GB. The 
other two options involve copying the disk image to an NFS or Windows share on 
the local area network.

Saving Disk Images Locally to the USB Flash Drive 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To save the disk image to the reflash Utility drive, copy the disk image(s) 
into the Images directory on the flash drive.

Storing Disk Images on a Network Share
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the disk image(s) to a Windows shared drive or NFS mounted directory. The 
screenshot below shows an example of how to copy a disk image to a Windows 
network drive called WES images.
