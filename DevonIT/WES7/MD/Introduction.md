# Introduction

## What is Windows Embedded 8 Standard?

Windows Embedded 8 Standard (WE8S) is an embedded operating system and successor to Windows Embedded Standard 7, updated to match the components of the Windows 8 operating system.  It also provides the Windows 8 interface.

## WE8S Features

* **Multimedia Web Browsing-** WE8S comes equipped with Internet Explorer 10 with improved navigation and supports CSS styling and RSS feeds.  Windows Media Player 12 is included to manage digital music, photos, and video libraries.  WE8S also comes with Microsoft Silverlight for running interactive applications right from the thin client, DirectX 11 for 3D and full-color video, and supports both digital and analog television for streaming shows or recording videos.
* **Modern Networking-** WE8S can connect to the hosted desktops using the industry's best protocols, including PCoIP, Citrix, RDP compatibility with RemoteFX, and VMware Horizon View. WE8S also uses 802.11, 802.1X, and WPA2 for wireless connections and protection, Plug and Play support for intelligent devices, USB 2.0 and 3.0 support, and Internet Connection Sharing.
* **Third Party Clients-** DevonIT thin clients include commonly used client server applications such as the Citrix Online Plug-in and VMware Horizon View.
* **File-Based Write Filter (FBWF)-** This feature allows the administrator to select individual files or folders to be protected from change while other files/folders on the same partition can be updated.
* **USB Flash Boot-** Thin clients are capable of being re-imaged from a bootable USB Flash Device with the .EXE re-imagining executable file on it and the compressed image file in the .gz format.
* **Centralized Management-** DevonIT thin clients with WE8S can be easily managed with the DevonIT Echo Management Console.

## First Boot Wizard

The first time the terminal boots up, the first boot wizard will need to be used for the initial setup process.  This wizard can help to configure a variety of settings in order to better use the thin client.  Users are advised to become familiar with the materials in this guide, as well as the Echo Administration Guide, to properly operate the first boot wizard.
