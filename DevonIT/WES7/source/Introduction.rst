What is Windows Embedded 7 Standard?
------------------------------------

Windows Embedded Standard 7 (WES7) is an embedded operating system and
successor to Windows Embedded Standard 2009, updated to match the
components of the Windows 7 operating system. It also provides the
Windows 7 interface.

WES7 Features
-------------

-  **Multimedia Web Browsing-** WES7 comes equipped with Internet
   Explorer 10 with improved navigation and supports CSS styling and RSS
   feeds. Windows Media Player 12 is included to manage digital music,
   photos, and video libraries. WES7 also comes with Microsoft
   Silverlight for running interactive applications right from the thin
   client, DirectX 11 for 3D and full-color video, and supports both
   digital and analog television for streaming shows or recording
   videos.
-  **Modern Networking-** WES7 can connect to the hosted desktops using
   the industry's best protocols, including PCoIP, Citrix, RDP
   compatibility with RemoteFX, and VMware Horizon View. WES7 also uses
   802.11, 802.1X, and WPA2 for wireless connections and protection,
   Plug and Play support for intelligent devices, USB 2.0 and 3.0
   support, and Internet Connection Sharing.
-  **Third Party Clients-** Lenovo thin clients include commonly used
   client server applications such as the Citrix Online Plug-in and
   VMware Horizon View.
-  **File-Based Write Filter (FBWF)-** This feature allows the
   administrator to select individual files or folders to be protected
   from change while other files/folders on the same partition can be
   updated.
-  **USB Flash Boot-** Thin clients are capable of being re-imaged from
   a bootable USB Flash Device with the .EXE re-imagining executable
   file on it and the compressed image file in the .gz format.
-  **Centralized Management-** Lenovo thin clients with WES7 can be
   easily managed with the Lenovo Thin Client Management Console.

First Boot Wizard
-----------------

The first time the terminal boots up, the first boot wizard will need to
be used for the initial setup process. This wizard can help to configure
a variety of settings in order to better use the thin client. Users are
advised to become familiar with the materials in this guide, as well as
the LTM Administration Guide, to properly operate the first boot
wizard.
