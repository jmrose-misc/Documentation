Naming the Thin Client, Joining a Domain or Workgroup
-----------------------------------------------------

Naming the Thin Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The thin client can be renamed to make it easier to identify when
attempting to access an Active Directory Domain. To rename the thin
client, follow these steps:

1. While logged in as an Administrator, open the Windows **Control
   Panel** from the **Settings** option of the **Start** menu. Under
   **System...**, select the **Advanced system settings** option,
   located on the sidebar.
2. Open the **Computer Name** tab and press the **Change** button to
   bring up the **Computer Name/Domain Change** window. Enter a new name
   that will be assigned to the thin client for the network
   neighborhood. If the thin client is renamed while it is not connected
   to a network, there is a risk of a duplicate name being assigned.
   Remember to check with a network Administrator before renaming a thin
   client.
3. Once the thin client has been renamed, press the **OK** button to
   confirm the changes. In most cases, a reboot will be required in
   order to correctly apply a rename.

Joining a Domain or Workgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: 
   Performing the following steps may require Domain administrative rights. Consult a network administrator before proceeding.

1. While logged in as an Administrator, open the Windows **Control
   Panel** from the **Settings** option of the **Start** menu. Under
   **System...**, select the **Advanced system settings** option,
   located on the sidebar.
2. Open the **Computer Name** tab and press the **Change** button to
   bring up the **Computer Name/Domain Change** window. Enter the domain
   or workgroup name that the thin client will join and press the *OK*
   button to confirm. A notification may appear if joining the domain or
   workgroup has succeeded or failed.
3. The thin client will need to be rebooted to proceed with its new
   domain or workgroup.

Using the Join a Domain or Workgroup Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Performing the following steps may require Domain administrative rights. Consult a network administrator before proceeding.

The **Join a Domain or Workgroup Wizard** may also be used to join a
domain or workgroup. It presents a series of questions and information
fields about the network and configures the system accordingly.

1. While logged in as an Administrator, open the Windows **Control
   Panel** from the **Settings** option of the **Start** menu. Under
   **Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings**, select the
   **Change settings** option.
2. Open the **Computer Name** tab and press the **Network ID...**
   button. The **Join a Domain or Workgroup Wizard** will appear.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and answer the questions to
   configure the Domain or Workgroup. Once complete, press the
   **Finish** button and reboot the thin client to apply the changes.
