Setting Static/Dynamic IP
-------------------------

By default, the thin client has its IP assigned automatically by DHCP,
making it dynamic. To set the IP to a static address on the network,
follow these steps:

1. While logged in as an Administrator, open the Windows **Control
   Panel** from the **Settings** option of the **Start** menu. Under
   **Network and Sharing Center**, select the **View network status and
   tasks** option.
2. Locate and select the network connection that is in use. This will be
   called **Local Area Connection** if an Ethernet cable is being used.
   The **Local Area Connection Status** window will appear. Press the
   **Properties** button. A new window will appear, displaying the
   **Local Area Connection Properties**.
3. The **Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4)** option will be located
   at the bottom of the dialogue box within the window. Highlight this
   **TCP/IPv4** and press the **Properties** button to bring up a new IP
   properties window.
4. Select the **Use the following IP address** option, then complete the
   information boxes for the desired static IP address, subnet mask,
   default gateway, and DNS server(s). Consult a network administrator
   if assistance is required to fill out any of this information. Once
   all of the information has been entered, press the **OK** button to
   apply the reconfigured IP address.
