What is a User Account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The term user account should not be confused with the actual User
account that is the default account upon log-in. For each person using
the terminal, the owner can create an individual account. Each user
account created may have certain rights or permissions as chosen by the
Administrator account. The Administrator account is able to create,
delete, and edit each of the user's settings whenever needed.

User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The User Account is the account that will automatically log-in at every
boot. It is also the account that should be used for guests or any user
that should be prohibited from modifying the thin client or its local
drive in any way. There is no password on this account by default. The
User Account holder may change the account picture and create, delete,
or change their account password. The User Account cannot edit its own
account name or account type, nor can it install or uninstall any
software. It may, however, use software installed by the Administrator
account.

Administrator Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the User Account is automatically logged in. Logging out of 
the User Account will allow for easy switching to any other available 
accounts. If an account is currently logged in on a desktop, then it is
also possible to switch to a different account by accessing the Account 
menu on the upper right-hand side of the **Start** screen and selecting 
the account that will be used instead.

.. NOTE:: 
   The default password for the Administrator is 000000.
	 
Logging into the Administrator account should be very similar to the
User account, with some additional icons on the desktop. Unlike the User
account(s), the Administrator account can:

-  Install and uninstall hardware and software.
-  Create and delete user accounts on the terminal.
-  Add or edit account passwords for user accounts on the terminal.
-  Edit names, pictures, and passwords.
-  Upgrade a user's account type to have administrator access.

.. NOTE::
   The Administrator account cannot downgrade its own account type to a limited User account type unless there is at least one other account with administrator privileges on the thin client. This ensures that there is always at least one administrator-level account on the thin client.
