Customizing the Thin Client
---------------------------

This section details how to change some of the options on the thin
client to fit any home or business requirements.

Disabling the Automatic Log-In
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Holding down the **Windows** button, press <**R**> to access the
   Run: dialogue box. Enter "*control userpasswords2*" (without
   quotations).
2. Check the box that says **Users must enter a user name and password
   to use this computer**. Select **Administrator account**. Press
   **Apply** to save all changes.

After the initial boot-up, or when booting up after using the re-imaging 
utility, the thin client will display the Windows Embedded desktop, taskbar, 
and system tray.

Sleep Mode
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, WE8S will enter sleep mode after 25 minutes of inactivity. While in 
sleep mode, no management actions via LTM can be taken, unless the thin client is 
woken up by LTM's Wake-on-LAN option or if the thin client is woken up with a 
manual action (keyboard button press, mouse click, etc.).
