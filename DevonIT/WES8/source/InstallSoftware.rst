2. Access the **FBWF/EWF Manager** page. Temporarily disable the write
   filter by selecting the **Disable Restrictions** option. Press the
   **Apply** button to save this change and disable FBWF.
3. Reboot the thin client. Log back into an administrator account and
   install the new software.
4. After installation, verify that the application is working as
   expected.
5. To re-enable the FBWF, open the **LTM Control Panel** and access the
   **FBWF/EWF Manager** page. Select the **Enable FBWF** option. If they
   are currently not selected, re-enable the **Documents and Settings
   for Everyone** and **Persistent Registry** options. There will be no
   exclusions for EWF if that is enabled. Press the **Apply** button to
   save the changes.
