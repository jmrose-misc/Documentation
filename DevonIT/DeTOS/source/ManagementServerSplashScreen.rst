Management Server Splash Screen
-------------------------------

If the thin client cannot make contact with a Management Server during
boot-up, then a splash screen will appear just prior to the desktop
loading. This screen contains the Lenovo logo and displays a message
saying, “Attempting to connect to Management Server.” The splash screen
will be displayed until successful contact is made with a management
server, the cancel button is pressed, or the specified timeout (30
seconds by default) is reached.

The **Management** section, found under the **Control Panel**, allows
configuration of the behavior of this splash screen. Configuration
options include:

+  Setting the thin client to **Managed** or **Unmanaged** modes

+  Specifying a different management server address

+  Adjusting the timeout value

+  Enabling or disabling the splash screen **Cancel** button
