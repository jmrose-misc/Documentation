    Clear Local Storage
        Press this button to clear out all configurations currently stored. Reboot the thin client after this option has been selected to clear out all locally stored configurations. This is a factory reset and will result in starting the first boot wizard again.

        .. NOTE::
            Clearing Local Storage will not remove any software packages that have been installed. Software packages will need to be removed separately.
        
    Take Snapshot
        Press this button to capture the thin clientâ€™s current connections and settings configuration. Rebooting the terminal will allow the terminal to restore to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken. Taking a snapshot after applying new changes is neccessary to ensure that the adjustments will be retained after a reboot.
