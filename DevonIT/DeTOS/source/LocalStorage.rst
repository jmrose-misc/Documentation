Local Storage
=============

Persistence, within the scope of thin client computing, refers to the
continuing existence of connections and settings after a terminal has
been rebooted.

Upon completion of the first boot wizard, a snapshot of the thin client
may be taken and saved in a data partition for basic settings. All of
the connections, settings, and network settings assigned during the
first boot wizard will be saved once this snapshot is taken and they
will persist and carry over after a reboot.

After this point, only changes made to Network Settings and Management
servers will automatically persist if changed through the Control Panel.
In order for alterations to connections or settings to persist after
this point, either the changes will have to be applied through the
Management console or the **Take Snapshot** option, located in the
**Local Storage** settings section of the Control Panel, must be used 
after making any changes. (See :ref:`localstoragesettings` for more 
information.)
