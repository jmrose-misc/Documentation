What is LeTOS?
--------------

Lenovo® Terminal Operating System (LeTOS™) is an embedded Thin Client
Operating System designed to be simple, secure, and centrally
manageable. LeTOS can be used to access hosted desktops using Microsoft®
Remote Desktop Services®, VMware® Horizon View™, Citrix® XenAppView® or
XenDesktop®, web-based applications, and more.

LeTOS Features
--------------

+  **Simple** - Configuring a session out of the box is quick and painless
   using the LeTOS intuitive web based control panel. The same control
   panel can be used either locally from the thin client or remotely from
   the management software.

+  **Modern** - LeTOS can connect to hosted desktops using the industry’s
   best protocols including Citric ICA® Client, Citrix XenDesktop, RDP or
   Windows® Terminal Services, and VMware Horizon View Client. LeTOS also
   includes a built-in browser that allows accessing web-based applications
   or kiosk usage.

+  **Centrally Managed** - LeTOS-based thin clients can be centrally
   managed using the Lenovo® Thin Client Management Console™, or LTM™.

   - The Management Console is shipped as a virtual appliance, so it is easy to set up.

   - LTM can automatically discover and inventory the thin clients on the network.

   - LTM has the concept of a default profile. Using a default profile, additional thin clients are automatically configured when plugged into the network.

   - Individual profiles for different users, including specific Connections, Thin Client Settings, and Passwords.

   - LTM supports updates to the thin client’s embedded OS. Updates can be scheduled to happen outside of production hours, for example over the weekend.
