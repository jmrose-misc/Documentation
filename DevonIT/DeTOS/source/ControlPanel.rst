Control Panel
-------------

The **Control Panel** is the local tool for configuring **Connection**
and **System** settings on the thin client.

Connection Settings
	The thin client has the ability to connect to
	remote servers utilizing several types of protocols. The RDP® client
	uses the RDP protocol and allows connections to Windows® Terminal
	Servers. The Citrix ICA client is used to establish connections to
	Citrix Presentation and XenAppView servers. The VMware Horizon View
	client allows a connection to a VMware Horizon View server, which in
	turn, provides the end-user with their own virtual desktop session.
	Lastly, a Firefox® web browser connection may be created to surf the
	web. This can be used for several purposes:

	- Connect to a web applications; e.g., a webmail server.

	- Connect to a connection broker web interface; e.g., Citrix XenDesktop.

	- Use the thin client as a Kiosk (select the **Enable Kiosk Mode** button under the **Kiosk Mode** panel)

System Settings
	These are the display, locale, sound, keyboard,
	mouse, desktop appearance, printer, and date/time configurations for
	the thin client. Also under the System section is the ability to set
	an administrative password for the control panel and to allow a
	snapshot of the current desktop configuration to be stored.
