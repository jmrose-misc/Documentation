LeTOS Installation
------------------

No installation is required for customers who have purchased LeTOS-based
thin clients from Lenovo. The thin client already contains a factory
installed LeTOS operating system. A USB re\ **-**\ flash utility is
available if reinstalling the operating system is necessary at any point
in the future.
