Adding New Connections
----------------------

1. Open the **LeTOS Control Panel** from the **Start** menu.

2. Click on the connection that will be created; it is listed under the
   **Connections** bar, on the left-hand side of the **Control Panel**.

3. The main window will split into two separate frames. The top frame
   will list all existing connections for this particular type or
   protocol. To add a new connection, click the **Add** button.

4. A prompt will appear, requesting for a name to be given to this
   connection. Enter a name for this connection and press the **OK**
   button to continue.

5. The bottom frame will display configuration fields that are specific
   to the connection type being created. Some connections may only have
   a couple of fields required for configuration and be listed on a
   single form. Connections that have several configuration options
   associated with them will have their settings grouped and sorted
   under separate sections, called form panels. These panels can be
   opened and closed by clicking the plus [+] and minus [-] buttons
   found along the top, right-hand side of each panel box.

6. Once the connection has been completely setup, click the **Apply**
   button along the bottom of the frame. An icon for the new session
   will be created on the LeTOS Desktop. The end user can double-click
   this icon to launch the connection.

    .. NOTE::
        Certain devices may not support all connections listed.

7. As connections are created in the **Control Panel**, icons for those
   sessions will appear on the desktop. Double-click the icon to launch
   that session.
