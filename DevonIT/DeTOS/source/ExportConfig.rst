Export Config
-------------

In rare instances where support is needed, users may be asked to provide
the thin client’s current configuration to the support team. The thin
client’s current configuration file can be exported by following these
steps:

1. Plug a USB flash drive into the thin client.

2. Click the button found along the top of the **Control Panel** named
   **Export Config**.

3. The process only takes a few seconds. Once it is finished a message
   will display, saying the export is finished and the flash drive can
   be removed.

4. A **Config.tar** file will now exist on the flash drive. This file
   contains important diagnostic information that can be handled by a
   Support Analyst and will help troubleshoot and solve issues that may
   be experienced.
