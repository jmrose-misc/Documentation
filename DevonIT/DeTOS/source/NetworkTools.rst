Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is difficulty connecting to servers on certain segments of the
LAN, then the ping command is available to verify that specific servers
and/or gateways on the subnet are being reached. To use ping:

1. Select the **Diagnostics** tab from the **Network Tools** window.

2. In the **Host Address** field, type in the IP address or website to
   test against and then press the **Ping** button.

3. If there is an error in the delivery to the destination, the ping
   command displays an error message. Otherwise, replies will
   continuously display for each packet successfully sent and received.

4. Press the **Stop** button to terminate the ping loop.
