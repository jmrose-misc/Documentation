First Boot Wizard
-----------------

The first time the thin client boots up, the first boot wizard will need
to be used for the initial setup process. This wizard can help to
configure a variety of settings in order to better operate the thin
client. Users are advised to become familiar with the material in this
guide as well as the LTM Administration Guide to best implement the
first boot wizard.
