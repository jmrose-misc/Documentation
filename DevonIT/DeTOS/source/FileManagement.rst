File Management
---------------

LeTOS includes **QtFM** for basic file management needs using external storage 
devices. With it, users are able to perform simple actions for file 
maintenance. 

To access QtFM:

1. Insert a USB storage device into one of the USB ports available on the 
   device that being used.
   
2. An icon will appear on the desktop taskbar, along with a notification 
   stating that the storage device has been discovered by LeTOS and may be 
   accessed. Click on either the notification or on the taskbar icon to 
   open QtFM.
   
Files within the storage device can be moved, copied, renamed, and even deleted.

.. NOTE::
	Only files within storage units may be accessed and edited by QtFM.
