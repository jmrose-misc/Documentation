Navigation Tabs
    A term used to reference the various tabs located on the left-hand side of 
    the LTM Administration screen. These tabs provide quick access to the 
    various inventory tables. 
Inventory Tables
    Inventory Tables are the lists of items presented in a table format that is 
    located in the middle area of the LTM Administration screen. Upon clicking 
    on Navigation Tabs such as Devices or Profiles, among others, an inventory 
    table will open for those specific sections. 
Device
    This is the device in front of the user, to which their screen, keyboard 
    and mouse are attached. In LTM, the Devices tab will display an inventory 
    containing all of the devices being managed by the LTM server. 
Shadow
    Shadow is a method that allows Administrators and Users with approved 
    permissions to shadow one host device at a time. This allows LTM to view 
    and interact with the desktop of the host device.
Connection
    A connection is a method used to connect a device to a remote server. The 
    Connections tab in LTM will display an inventory containing all of the 
    RDP, ICA, VMware View, and other connections that have been created. 
Profile
    A profile is a combination of device settings and connections that can be 
    created in order to provide easily applied groupings of settings to 
    multiple devices. The Profiles tab is where the administrator can create, 
    edit, and apply these profiles to the devices. 
Disk Image
    A disk image is a file that contains an all encompassing set of information 
    that can be applied to a device, including the operating system. The Disk 
    Images tab opens the inventory table that allows users to create, edit, and 
    apply disk images as needed. 
Device Settings
    Device settings are limited to the display, sound, keyboard, mouse, and 
    password configurations for a device. The Device Settings tab displays the 
    inventory table containing the groups of settings that have been cloned 
    from devices. Applying device settings to a device is performed through the 
    Device inventory table. 
Certificate
    Certificates provide users with the credentials needed to access certain 
    websites or services. While certificates can be obtained in a number of 
    ways, the Certificates tab in LTM allows users to store specific 
    certificates that can then be applied to devices through the Device 
    inventory table. 
Software
    Software packages allow administrators to patch existing images on devices 
    or update to new versions of existing software. The Software tab in LTM 
    displays the inventory of administrator-approved packages. 
Tasks
    Tasks allow users to schedule device activity for later execution. Tasks 
    must be scheduled from the Devices tab. The Tasks tab will allow users to 
    view the status and schedule of all tasks that have been set on the server. 
Imprivata
    Imprivata OneSign provides one-touch single sign-on solutions for operating
    systems that support it. A certificate may be required. The Imprivata tab
    will display all available OneSign configurations that may be applied to
    devices.
Logs
    Logs are records of server events that administrators can use to keep track 
    of what is occurring with the managed devices. 
Settings
    The Settings tab is used in LTM as a reference to the process of 
    maintaining and updating the LTM server itself. The Settings tab has 
    several subsections that allow an administrator to carry out a number of 
    useful processes to keep the server running smoothly. 
Help
    Help is a tab where the user can view a number of resources to assist with 
    running LTM. There is also a brief administration guide and a link to the 
    full length LTM Administration Guide.
