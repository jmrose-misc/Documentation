Device Network Configuration
----------------------------

The Management Appliance provides the ability to remotely set the network 
configuration of a thin client. With this feature, Administrators are able to 
set a static IP to a device, or enable or disable Wake-On-LAN functionality.
Only one device can be adjusted at a time. A Network Administrator may need to 
be consulted to get the information required here.

Use DHCP
    This option will enable a DHCP protocol for connectivity. This option is 
    normally enabled by default on devices. When disabled, new fields will be 
    available and static information can be set for the device.
   
Wake-On-Lan
    This option will enable or disable Wake-On-LAN functionality. By default, 
    Wake-On-LAN is enabled. Wake-On-LAN also has the ability to work across
    subnets. This requires the router to be configured to forward broadcast
    packets.
