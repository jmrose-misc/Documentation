Filter
------

Only available in the **Devices** table, the **Filter** button offers two 
unique features. The **Connected** setting will organize devices based on 
connectivity, starting with devices that the network can reach. Selecting 
**Connected** again will instead filter unreachable devices to the top of 
the list.

The **Show/Hide Group Tray** will display or hide the Group Filter interface. 
This displays all of the groups that devices can be sorted into. The checkbox 
next to each group will filter the Device Inventory to display all devices 
associated with all of the selected groups. The `Filter Groups` field is 
available for cases where a large number of groups are present. This filter 
will display all applicable groups based on what has been typed into the text 
field, and will automatically update the group list as text is entered.
