Export
------

The **Export** tool in the **Devices** inventory table allows
administrators to export the data contained within the **Devices** table
to a file type of their choosing from the dropdown menu. **Remote Logs**
for a device are also able to be exported as a word document file. This
option is only available when devices have been selected.
