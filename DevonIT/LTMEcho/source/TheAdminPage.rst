The Administration Page
-----------------------

The **Administration Page** is divided into two main sections. The
left-hand side displays the navigation bar with the various pages the
administrator can navigate to. The central area of the page is dedicated
to the inventory or configuration table depending on which tab is
selected. The different administration pages are briefly described
below. For further instruction on each page, see the :ref:`devices-reference`
chapter.
