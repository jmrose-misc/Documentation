Device Actions
--------------

The **Device Actions** button opens a dropdown menu that contains a
large number of actions that can be used on a device, such as applying
or cloning settings, rebooting the device, or initiating a Shadow
session. Many of the options are outlined in later sections.

Device Actions may change based on devices selected. The actions that
are made available depend on single and multi-device selection,
selecting devices with varying operating systems, selecting devices with
differing connectivity statuses, or even a variation of
cross-possibilities.

Permissions will also affect the Device Actions a user can take. Active 
Directory groups with restrictions may not be able to access 
certain actions based on the permissions set.

-  **View** - Viewing objects on a device requires device read permissions, 
   as well as read permissions on the object type that is being viewed.

-  **Apply** - Applying objects to a device requires write permissions to 
   devices, and a minimum of read permissions for the object type that is 
   to be applied to the device.

-  **Clone** - Cloning objects from a device requires a minimum of read 
   permissions to devices, but full write permissions for the object type 
   that is being cloned from the device.

-  **Remove** - Removing objects from a device requires write permissions 
   to devices, and a minimum of read permissions for the object type that 
   is being removed from the device.

Any unlisted actions require a minimum of write permissions to devices.
