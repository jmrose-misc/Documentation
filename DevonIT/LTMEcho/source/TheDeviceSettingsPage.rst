Device Settings Page
--------------------

**Device Settings** are the various settings, including display, sound,
keyboard, mouse, and password configurations, for a particular device.
Administrators can use the management platform to clone these settings
from one device, store them within the database, and then apply them to
other devices.

.. NOTE::
   For more information on how to configure device settings,
   please refer to the OS guide. Details on how to alter these settings,
   install MUI packs, and select languages can be found there.
