Searches
--------

The **Search** bar, located on the upper right-hand side of each
inventory table, allows users to easily search that table for specific
information. A search scans all possible fields in each table, so it is
possible to narrow the visible items based on specified criteria.
Finding devices that share a common IP address, have the same model
type, or use the same OS are a few of the many uses of this feature.

For example, if an administrator has to perform an update on all devices
running LeTOS, typing “LeTOS” into the search field displays only those
devices in the inventory table. The administrator can then perform
updates with a more focused view of the devices being managed.

A new feature of the Management Appliance, **Groups**, supports usage as
a search term. Click on the group tag of a device, or enter “group:”,
and all devices that have been assigned to that group will display in
the inventory table. As information is entered into the Search field,
the inventory table will automatically update and display the items that
match the search criteria.
