Devices Page
------------

The **Devices** page is where users may view an inventory of all devices
being managed by the platform. Information such as the
**Name**, **IP Address**, **OS**, and other details for each device
can be viewed here.

Next to each device is a **View Device** button, a **Logs** button, and
a checkbox, used to select any number of devices at once. A group of
devices can be selected by clicking on a deviceâ€™s checkbox, followed by
pressing ``Shift`` and clicking on the last device to be selected for that
group. The **View Device** button lists all available details pertaining
to the device not displayed by default in the inventory, such as the
Serial Number or UUID. The **Logs** button displays any logged events
from the selected device(s).
