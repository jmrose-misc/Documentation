Database Hotcopy
----------------

.. index::
   single: Restoration

A back up of the management server can be created from the main
**Database Hotcopy** tab. The method used is referred to as a 'Hotcopy'
since the backup is created while the system is running. There is no
need to stop or suspend the Management Appliance for the backup. To
execute a Hotcopy, perform the following procedure:

#. Click on **Backup Server** button at the top of the **Database
   Hotcopy** page.

#. A **Backup Server Settings** dialogue box will open. Administrators
   can then select which tables should be included within the Hotcopy
   being created by checking or unchecking the boxes next to the various
   options.

#. Once all of the needed adjustments have been made, click on the
   checkmark at the top right hand corner of the **Backup Server
   Settings** dialogue box to begin making the Hotcopy itself.

#. The result of the Hotcopy will create a binary (**.BIN**) backup file
   that will be downloaded to the local machine. Click **Save File** and
   make a note of where the file is saved, as it will be needed it in
   the future to perform a restore.
