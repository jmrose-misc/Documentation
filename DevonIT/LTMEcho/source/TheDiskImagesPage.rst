Disk Images Page
----------------

A **Disk Image** is a file that can be included in order to combine
different settings and profiles into one complete package. While
creating **Profiles** and editing **Device Settings** provide ways
to customize devices, uploading a **Disk Image** allows the
administrator to combine multiple profiles and settings, as well as an
operating system, into a single resource. Utilizing disk images can
simplify the management process.
