   single: X11

X11 connections are used to run an X11 application through SSH or to connect to 
a server via XDMCP.

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Name
    The name of the connection. The name is a required field when a new 
    connection is created. 
Local Display Name
    The local display name is what the connection will be labeled with on the
    device. This field is required in order to create a new connection. 
Description
    A description such as "Kiosk Connection" or "Presentation Connection." The
    description field is optional, but it is recommended to use descriptions to
    help organize connections.  
Protocol
    The protocol used in the connection is displayed here. 

General
~~~~~~~

Session Type
    The session type for the X11 connection. Users can choose between using an 
    XDMCP connection or using the X11 SSH application. 
Server URL
    The URL (or IP address) of the X11 server.
Username
    The default username for the X11 session. Leaving this field blank will 
    allow those that use this connection to log in with their desired username 
    when they connect. 
Password
    Setting a password in this field, combined with entering a username above, 
    will enable automatic login as the specified user. 
Application Name
    If the session type selected is X11 SSH App, then an application's filepath 
    can be entered here. Otherwise this field can be left blank. 
Screen Resolution
    The screen resolution for the X11 session. If an X11 SSH App session is in 
    use, then some applications may not support all available resolutions. 
Autostart
    Causes the connection to start as soon as the device is powered on. 
Auto Restart
    Causes the connection to be restarted if it is closed. This is useful for 
    administrators that wish to limit the ability of a user to access the 
    device. 
Disable Desktop
    This will disable desktop access, ensuring that users only access this 
    specific workstation with the specific credentials applied to the 
    connection. Logging off from the server will power off the thin client, and 
    powering on the thin client will bypass the operating system's desktop and 
    immediately log in to the server. This feature is not supported for 
    Windows-based operating systems.
