#. From the **Storage Locations** inventory tab, click on the **Add**
   button at the top of the page.

#. The **Add Storage Location** dropdown menu will open. There are four
   fields that must be filled out in order to successfully add a new
   storage location:

   -  **Name** - Enter a name for the storage location being added.

   -  **URL** - Enter the complete URL of the storage location.

   -  **Username** - If a username is needed to access the storage
      location being added, enter it in this field.

   -  **Password** - If a password is needed to access the storage
      location being added, enter it in this field.

#. Once all of the fields have been correctly filled out, click on the
   checkmark in the top right corner of the **Add Storage Location**
   menu to add the new entry.

Once completed, the new location will appear in the list of inventoried
storage locations. Entries in this table will be included in the
**Storage Location** fields when choosing where to save disk images and
packages.

.. NOTE::
   Removing a Storage Location from inventory will also remove all Devices, 
   Disk Images, and Software Packages that are associated with the product.
