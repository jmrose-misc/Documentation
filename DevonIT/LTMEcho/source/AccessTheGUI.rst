Accessing the Graphical Interface
---------------------------------

1. Using a web browser, type the server address that was assigned to the 
   Management Appliance into the address bar.

   .. NOTE::
      An untrusted connection warning may appear within the browser. This 
      will need to be bypassed, and the Management server will need to be 
      added as an exception.
   
2. Enter a username and password. This login can be the Administrator 
   credentials that were set up during installation, or another set of 
   credentials based on Active Directory accounts, if established. Click on 
   the **Login** button. If properly configured, and DNS settings are correct, 
   the **Administration Page** will display.
