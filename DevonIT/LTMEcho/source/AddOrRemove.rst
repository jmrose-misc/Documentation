Add or Remove
-------------

The **Add** and **Remove** icons perform different tasks depending on
which page is open. When used on the **Devices** tab, for instance,
these icons will allow the administrator to either add a new device to
the managed devices list by entering an IP address, or to remove
selected devices from the list. On the other pages, these icons are used
to either create new entries (like profiles or disk images), or to
remove entries.
