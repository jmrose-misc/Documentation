Licenses
--------

The **Licenses** tab can be used to apply licensing keys for the VDI
Blasterâ„¢ software. To add a license to the inventory:

#. From the **Licenses** inventory table, click the **Add** button at
   the top of the page. This will open the **Add License** menu.

#. In the field labeled **License Key**, enter in the VDI Blaster key
   exactly as it appears.

#. Once the key has been correctly entered, click on the checkmark at
   the top right hand corner of the **Add License** menu to apply the
   license to the Management Appliance.

Once a key has been applied, it will appear in the **Licenses**
inventory table. Each key allows a limited number of devices to be
managed by the Management Appliance, and this number is listed in the
**Allowed Devices** column. Keep in mind that these licenses are applied
in a first-come, first-served manner.
