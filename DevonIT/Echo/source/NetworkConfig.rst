Network Configuration
---------------------

After the password and time zone have been configured, the next step of
the initial setup wizard is to determine the IP configuration.

#. Enter a static IP address for this instance of the management
   platform, and press **OK**.
#. On the next page will be a prompt to enter the subnet mask.
   Typically, this will be a class C subnet mask (``255.255.255.0``). Once
   the subnet mask has been filled in, press **OK**.
#. On the **Configure Gateway** page, enter the gateway IP address and
   press **OK**.
#. On the **Configure DNS Nameservers** page, enter the IP addresses of
   the nameservers, using a space in between each address. This will
   allow the appliance to resolve domain names. Once the IP addresses
   have been entered, press **OK**.
#. In the **Configure DNS Search Domains** page, enter the DNS search
   path for the domain. If there are multiple domains, separate the
   entries with a space. Once all domains have been entered, press
   **OK**.
#. After selecting **OK**, the network interface will restart and the
   **Main Menu** will display.
