Products
--------

When a device with an unknown product type is added to the inventory,
the management platform will automatically add the product to the known
products list. Products may then be used to restrict actions to a subset
of the inventory. For instance, a product may be specified when creating
a Software Package, to ensure that the software can only be applied to
devices running DeTOS.

.. NOTE::
   Removing a Product from inventory will also remove all Devices, Disk 
   Images, and Software Packages that are associated with the product.
