Restore Server
--------------

A restore deletes all existing configuration and data on the Management
Appliance and overwrites it with the information contained in a
previously created Hotcopy backup file. To perform a restore, follow
these steps:

#. In the **Database Hotcopy** tab, click the **Restore Server** button
   at the top of the page.

#. A **Restore Server** dialogue box will open. In the **Choose File**
   field, navigate to the .bin file containing the server data needed.

#. After the path to the backup file has been entered, click the
   checkmark at the top right corner of the **Restore Server** dialogue
   box to restore the server settings to those contained in the Hotcopy.

#. In the **Database Hotcopy** tab, click the **Legacy Restore** button
   at the top of the page.

#. A **Legacy Restore** dialogue box will open. In the **Choose File**
   field, navigate to the .bin file containing the server data needed.
   Below the Browse button is an option that states “Force restore even
   if some records can’t be processed”. This option is available due to
   differences that can occur between a legacy version and the current
   version of the Management Appliance, but is not required.

#. After the path to the backup file has been entered, click the
   checkmark at the top right corner of the **Legacy Restore** dialogue
   box to restore the server settings to those contained in the Hotcopy.
