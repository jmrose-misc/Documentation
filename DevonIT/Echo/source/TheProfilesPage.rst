Profiles Page
-------------

A key function of the management platform is the creation and
application of **Profiles**, in order to effectively manage the settings
applied to remote devices. A profile can contain a variety of options
such as connections, settings, certificates, disk images, and software
packages, which can then be applied to devices according to defined
rules. The **Profiles** page is where the administrator can create,
manage, and edit these profiles.
